**Game Start**  

1. Active player draws cards until he refills his hand to 6 cards.  
    > If the player cannot do so, he draws as many as he can. The player may lose the game when he passes the turn  

2. Active player can use any of the following actions:  
  
    * **Aegis**  
    * **Blitz** (cannot be used on the first turn of the game)  
    * **Sorcery** (cannot be used on the first turn of the game)  
    * **Fetch**  
    * **Shift**  
    * **Discard**  
  
3. As a response to any actions, both the Active and the Inactive player may use the special **Negate** action.  

    > If more than one player declares a Negate action in the same time, the Active player takes priority, then the Inactive player to their right, and so on.  

4. The Active player may also use the **Pass** action to pass the turn to the player to their right.  

    > When a player passes the turn with zero cards in their deck, then the player automatically loses the game.
